##UW eScience Incubator 

This blogging project is part of the UW eSceince incubator, designed at teaching big data techniques to non-computer scientists. This project represents an attempt to foster cooperation between disciplines and improve the ability of social and hard scientists to use the computing power available today to improve existing research. 

My name is [Emily Gade](http://www.polisci.washington.edu/Directory/Students/grads/grad_gade.html). I work for [John Wilkerson](http://www.polisci.washington.edu/Directory/Faculty/Faculty/faculty_wilkerson.html) and the [Center for American Politics and Public Policy.](http://cappp.org/) We are attempting to use an archive of captures of the .gov web domain as a new datasource for studying the transfer of ideas through politics. For more information see our [github wiki.](https://github.com/uwescience/incubator/wiki/dotgov_data)


There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* 


* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404.html), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
