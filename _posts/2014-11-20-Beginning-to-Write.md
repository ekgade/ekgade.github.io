##Back in my Comfort Zone! – Beginning to Write up Results ☺ 

Today, after meeting with John, I discovered I’m ready to jump out of the data world and back into my comfort zone! We are going to try and produce two papers, one which details the .gov data as a resource, possible scripts and codes, methodological issues, and then also some results. The second will be an article-style product about threat construction in the United States, and how threats are used in and around election cycles. This will use the data that we produced from the .gov cluster to speak to the way government imagines and constructs threats, and then relates it to the way publics perceive threats, and see how well they track, with the hope of being able to also match threats with monetary incentives, etc.
